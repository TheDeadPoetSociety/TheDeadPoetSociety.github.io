Tiklo and I both had the pleasure of going to our first conference just a few days ago.
And I think I can confidently say that it was an absolute blast and has lit the conference spark in each of us! 

We were off to a rocky start as I woke up that morning and realised to my horror
that I had could not find my ticket in my inbox at all...
As it happened we turned up anyway and I managed to take the place of a late drop out,
many thanks to the team for being able to facilitate my entry despite the mistake.
It was certainly a breath of fresh air to take a seat in the lovely grand hall of the art gallery after
half an hour of wondering if the next two days would be miserable!

It'd be wonderful to detail each of the talks here, but I'll let them speak for themselves when they are released
after their initial editing stage, please go and watch over them if you find the time,
the topics were phenomenal. The biggest take away from the conference for me was the energy that the tech scene gives
off. The speakers had a good range of diversity from gender to current profession, to experience within the field,
and each person had something really worthy to contribute. The range of people really reinforces the fact that
anyone is welcome to join and learn  

There was a CTF running over the course of the two days, which was a fun compliment to the talks.
We managed to scrape our way through a few of the tasks and get a quick 2-3 more challenges on the
board in the last half an hour. This placed us second, which was incredibly exciting!
It was nice to see experience from other CTF's paying dividends, a testament to getting better and
furthering our knowlegde there. The tournament was a real community effort as well, each break
between talks people were relaxing and chatting, helping each other out. Once again it created a
really welcoming environment that just reinforced the goals of the InfoSec community, meet great
people, learn and help learn, hack the world.

The entire experience has only left me more excited for next weeks Purplecon and Kiwicon,
there's no doubt in my mind that the talks and people will be of the same wonderfully high class
as Christchurch's premiere conference.
