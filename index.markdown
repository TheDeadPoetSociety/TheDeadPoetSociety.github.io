# Welcome to the official website of The Dead Poet Society!

We are a collection of technology enthusiasts with a keen interest in InfoSec.

We try to compete in as many CTFs as time allows us, and aim to write up answers and
dive into solutions for problems that are particularly interesting. It's important to
share knowledge, not only does it help you solidify your own understanding of the problem domain, 
but cultivates interest in others as well.

Hopefully even one article we write will pique someones curiosity / help lift a barrier in their own endeavours.
One moment makes it all worth it really

Please enjoy our content!

Regards,
